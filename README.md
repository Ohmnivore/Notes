# What is this?
This is a collection of my personal notes on various tech books. I realized that sometimes, a year or more after having
read a book, I would have forgotten almost everything about that subject if I hadn't applied the material in practice.
I decided to write bullet-point form summaries for almost every book I read to be able to quickly refresh my memory on books I've read (wouldn't want to waste that 5-6 hours' worth of reading). Thought they may be useful to other people
so here they are.

# But wait there's more!
I just came up with this idea of taking notes, so most files are still a WIP. I often read half a book, then get bored 
and start another one. Most of these summaries are still incomplete. From this README I'll only link to summaries which I
deem worthy of reading in their current state (doesn't mean they're fully done yet).
