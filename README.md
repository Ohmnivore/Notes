# What is this?
This is a collection of my personal notes on various tech books. I realized that sometimes, a year or more after having
read a book, I would have forgotten almost everything about that subject if I hadn't applied the material in practice.
I decided to write bullet-point form summaries for almost every book I read to be able to quickly refresh my memory on books I've read (wouldn't want to waste that 5-6 hours' worth of reading). Thought they may be useful to other people
so here they are.

# But wait there's more!
I just came up with this idea of taking notes, so most files are still a WIP. I often read half a book, then get bored 
and start another one. Most of these summaries are still incomplete. From this README I'll only link to summaries which I
deem worthy of reading in their current state (doesn't mean they're fully done yet).

# More++
All the notes are written in markdown, and they're the files in the repo's root directory. In the `html` directory you
have these same files, but converted to html by a small Python script (`html/md2html.py` if you're curious). The HTML
version has beautiful CSS
([WiTeX](https://github.com/AndrewBelt/WiTeX) by [AndrewBelt](https://github.com/AndrewBelt?tab=repositories))
and a TABLE OF CONTENTS! Of course, GitHub doesn't serve Content Types for this, so you can check the html versions
below, on RawGit, or just clone/dl the repo and view locally. I really think the html version is easier to read than
the GitHub markdown render.
