<h1 id="what-is-this">What is this?</h1>

<p>This is a collection of my personal notes on various tech books. I realized that sometimes, a year or more after having
read a book, I would have forgotten almost everything about that subject if I hadn't applied the material in practice.
I decided to write bullet-point form summaries for almost every book I read to be able to quickly refresh my memory on books I've read (wouldn't want to waste that 5-6 hours' worth of reading). Thought they may be useful to other people
so here they are.</p>

<h1 id="but-wait-theres-more">But wait there's more!</h1>

<p>I just came up with this idea of taking notes, so most files are still a WIP. I often read half a book, then get bored 
and start another one. Most of these summaries are still incomplete. From this README I'll only link to summaries which I
deem worthy of reading in their current state (doesn't mean they're fully done yet).</p>

<h1 id="more">More++</h1>

<p>All the notes are written in markdown, and they're the files in the repo's root directory. In the <code>html</code> directory you
have these same files, but converted to html by a small Python script (<code>html/md2html.py</code> if you're curious). The HTML
version has beautiful CSS
(<a href="https://github.com/AndrewBelt/WiTeX">WiTeX</a> by <a href="https://github.com/AndrewBelt?tab=repositories">AndrewBelt</a>)
and a TABLE OF CONTENTS! Of course, GitHub doesn't serve content types for this, so you can check out the html versions
below, on RawGit, or just clone/dl the repo and view locally. I really think the html version is easier to read than
the GitHub markdown render.</p>

<p>This is an excellent book. It shows you exactly how to use tools (mostly the aircrack-ng suite), while still
explaining how the underlying things work. In my opinion it has the perfect balance for someone who wants to learn
how to practically crack WLANs, while actually understanding what he's doing at a lower level. This also allows you
to easily find resources to learn more about the subject.</p>
